I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on (lights on, lights on, lights on)
You're the only one I've got my sights on (sights on, sights on, sights on)
Type of sex you could never put a price on (price on, price on, price on)
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on (dice on, dice on, dice on)
And I just want a baby with the right one
(I just want a baby with the right)
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
